## *download the repository:* <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadMoinFaisal/YOLOv8-DeepSORT-Object-Tracking.git" target="blank">   *YOLOv8-DeepSORT-Object-Tracking*</a>


1. Setup py env

2. move to -> YOLOv8-DeepSORT-Object-Tracking

3. install and upgrade dependencies  ->  `$ pip install -e '.[dev]'`

4. move to -> `ultralytics/yolo/v8/detect`

5. Downloading the DeepSORT Files From The Google Drive: *<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kna8eWGrSfzaR6DtNJ8_GchGgPMv3VC8?usp=sharing" target="blank"> DeepSORT_files</a>*

6. After downloading the DeepSORT Zip file from the drive, unzip it go into the subfolders and place the deep_sort_pytorch folder into the `yolo/v8/detect` folde

7. pick my files according to need

    * emission.py---------------- calculate realtime emission
    * predict_with_speed.py ---- measure realtime speed


8. run -> `$ python `*programme.py*` model=yolov8l.pt source="`*video_name.mp4*`" show=True`

9. output location will be shown in cmd after completing full progress.
